## Usage

1. Install the package via composer:
    ```shell
    composer require laravel-notification-channels/authy
    ```

2. Add the following lines to your `config/services.php` file, before the end of the array:

    ```php
    'authy' => [
        'mode' => env('AUTHY_MODE'),
        'keys' => [
            'production' => env('AUTHY_PRODUCTION_KEY'),
            'sandbox' => env('AUTHY_SANDBOX_KEY'),
        ],
    ],
    ```

3. If you haven't already: Register an Authy account -> Sign in -> Access dashboard -> Create new application -> Copy your API keys (you've two keys, one for production & another for testing/sandbox)

4. Inside your project's `.env` file past the following:

    ```ini
    AUTHY_MODE=production
    AUTHY_PRODUCTION_KEY=AuthyProductionKeyHere
    AUTHY_SANDBOX_KEY=AuthySandboxKeyHere
    ```

    > **Note:** make sure to replace `AuthyProductionKeyHere` & `AuthySandboxKeyHere` with your keys from the previous step

5. To route Authy notifications to the proper user, define a `routeNotificationForAuthy` method on your notifiable entity. This should return the **Authy Id** to which the notification should be sent. Example:

    ```php
    /**
     * Route notifications for the authy channel.
     *
     * @return int
     */
    public function routeNotificationForAuthy()
    {
        return $this->authy_id;
    }
    ```

    > **Note:** as you might thought, this requires a `authy_id` attribute in your notifiable entity, which may require additional field in the database table as well.

6. Now you can create notifications that use Authy channel as follows:

    ```php
    // app/Notifications/PhoneVerificationNotification.php

    namespace App\Notifications;

    use Illuminate\Notifications\Notification;
    use NotificationChannels\Authy\AuthyChannel;
    use NotificationChannels\Authy\AuthyMessage;

    class PhoneVerificationNotification extends Notification
    {
        /**
         * Determine whether to force the notification over cellphone network.
         *
         * @var bool
         */
        public $force;

        /**
         * The notification method (sms/call).
         *
         * @var string
         */
        public $method;

        /**
         * Create a notification instance.
         *
         * @param bool   $force
         * @param string $method
         *
         * @return void
         */
        public function __construct($force, $method)
        {
            $this->force  = $force;
            $this->method = $method;
        }

        /**
         * Get the notification's channels.
         *
         * @param mixed $notifiable
         *
         * @return array|string
         */
        public function via($notifiable)
        {
            return [AuthyChannel::class];
        }

        /**
         * Build the mail representation of the notification.
         *
         * @return \NotificationChannels\Authy\AuthyMessage
         */
        public function toAuthy()
        {
            return AuthyMessage::create()->method($this->method)->force($this->force);
        }
    }
    ```

7. Finally you can consume the notification as follows:

    ```php
    $this->notify(new \App\Notifications\PhoneVerificationNotification(true, 'sms'));
    ```

    > **Note:** don't forget to read through [Authy TOTP API](https://docs.authy.com/totp.html) documentation for further information.

8. Done!
